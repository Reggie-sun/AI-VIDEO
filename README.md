# AI-VIDEO

Local-first Python CLI for orchestrating long-video generation through default-local ComfyUI. Non-local ComfyUI requires explicit opt-in.

The MVP reads a project config and shot list, renders ComfyUI workflow JSON per shot, submits each shot locally, extracts the last frame, passes that frame into the next shot, and stitches normalized clips with ffmpeg.

## Roadmap Status

The currently implemented runtime is the local-first `0.1.x` CLI described in this README. The v0.2 product direction is now an Agent-first AI Video / AI Comic Production Harness: Codex drives production decisions while the repository owns durable project state, asset provenance, dependency tracking, deterministic composition, rendering, and QA/repair receipts. That direction is planning-only; it does not make HyperFrames, Remotion, ElevenLabs, Captions, Audio, or a new project schema available today.

- Implemented local Legacy stabilization record: [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-08-ai-video-production-runtime-p1-runtime-truth-fixes.md`](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-08-ai-video-production-runtime-p1-runtime-truth-fixes.md)

Until a later slice is implemented and documented, the public commands remain `validate`, `run`, and `resume`; generation remains ComfyUI-only and default-local; Manifest v1 and the current artifact layout remain active. The four Legacy P1 fixes are present on local `main`, but this checkout is ahead of `origin/main`, so their GitHub publication is not implied.

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Requirements:

- Python 3.11+
- Local ComfyUI already running
- `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` on PATH

## Development MCP

Project-local MCP configuration exposes `video-analysis` as the default video inspection server for this repository.

If you also have a global `videoscan` MCP installed, treat it as optional helper tooling for metadata lookup or raw frame extraction only. For repo work here, use `video-analysis` for probing, scene detection, frame extraction, transcription, review, optimization planning, safe auto-application of config edits, and comprehensive analysis.

## Validate Example Files

```bash
ai-video validate --project configs/example.project.yaml --shots configs/example.shots.yaml
```

The example workflow is API-format JSON for validation and rendering tests.

There is also a real Wan 2.2 example wired from a ComfyUI UI-graph export:

```bash
ai-video validate --project configs/wan22.project.yaml --shots configs/wan22.shots.yaml
```

For faster iteration while tuning prompts, bindings, or workflow parameters, use the quick preset:

```bash
ai-video validate --project configs/wan22_fast.project.yaml --shots configs/wan22_quick.shots.yaml
```

The Wan 2.2 image-to-video presets expect the first shot to provide an `init_image`. Match that image's aspect ratio to your target output to avoid portrait clips being normalized into a landscape delivery.

## Workflow JSON

`ai-video` accepts either:

- ComfyUI API-format JSON
- ComfyUI UI workflow graph JSON

If you point to a UI workflow graph JSON, the CLI converts it to an API prompt before validation and submission. API-format JSON still remains the lowest-risk option when you want exact parity with a known exported prompt.

When the ComfyUI graph changes, update the matching binding file under `workflows/bindings/`.

## Run

```bash
ai-video run --project configs/example.project.yaml --shots configs/example.shots.yaml
```

For quick Wan 2.2 verification runs that finish much faster than the full 3-shot preset:

```bash
ai-video run --project configs/wan22_fast.project.yaml --shots configs/wan22_quick.shots.yaml --run-id quick-verify
```

Generated artifacts are written under `runs/<run_id>/`:

- `manifest.json`
- `shots/<shot_id>/clip.mp4`
- `shots/<shot_id>/last_frame.png`
- `normalized/<shot_id>.mp4`
- `final/final.mp4`

The runtime persists rendered workflow snapshots and every Shot Attempt history, including a terminal failure, before the original failure escapes. A later resume appends to that history. Delete old `runs/<run_id>` directories manually when you no longer need them.

## FPS Semantics

`defaults.fps` is both the generation fallback and the fixed delivery-normalization FPS. A Shot-level `fps` overrides only source workflow generation; it does not change normalization. This compatibility behavior adds no config or Manifest schema fields.

## Resume

```bash
ai-video resume --manifest runs/<run_id>/manifest.json
```

Resume reloads the existing Manifest and validates each successful Shot's persisted clip and last-frame hashes before deciding whether to skip it. For a Shot actually bound to the previous frame, resume also compares the persisted direct-upstream frame hash: a changed hash stales only its direct consumer, then propagates edge-by-edge when a new output changes the next upstream hash. An identical regenerated frame does not stale its consumer, and an explicit Shot `init_image` stops this previous-frame dependency. Character-reference hashes are recorded but are not validity inputs in P1.

## Real ComfyUI Smoke Test

1. Start local ComfyUI.
2. Verify a known-good image-to-video workflow manually.
3. Either export API-format JSON or save the UI workflow JSON.
4. Update the project config to point to that template.
5. Update the matching binding file so each path matches the workflow node IDs.
6. Run `ai-video validate`.
7. Run a 3-shot example.
8. Confirm every shot has `clip.mp4` and `last_frame.png`.
9. Confirm `final/final.mp4` plays.
